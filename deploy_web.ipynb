In this notebook, we'll make a [Flask app](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) to show how our models can interact with a web application which could be deployed to [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) with the [Flexible Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible)."

    "The `@app.route()` decorator defines a function to handle web reqests. Let's say our website is `www.example.com`. With how our `@app.route(\"/\")` function is defined, our sever will render our <a href=\"application/templates/index.html\">index.html</a> file when users go to `www.example.com/` (which is the default route for a website).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when a user pings our server with `www.example.com/predict`, they would use `@app.route(\"/predict\", methods=[\"POST\"])` to make a prediction. The data that gets sent over the internet isn't a dictionary, but a string like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`name1=value1&name2=value2` where `name` corresponds to the `name` on the input tag of our html form, and the value is what the user entered. Thankfully, Flask makes it easy to transform this string into a dictionary with `request.form.to_dict()`, but we still need to transform the data into a format our model expects. We've done this with the `gender2str` and the `plurality2str` utility functions.\n",
